Each LEI contains information about an entity's ownership structure and thus answers the questions of 'who is who' and 'who owns whom'. Simply put, the publicly available LEI data pool can be regarded as a global directory, which greatly enhances transparency in the global marketplace. Already applied very broadly within financial regulation and rapidly being adopted for KYC and a number of other purposes in financial markets, the LEI is set to spread into a range of other fields, including trade facilitation, business reporting and supply chain management.
